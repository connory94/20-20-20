there's this rule that helps to prevent eye strain, and eye strain sucks balls so I'd suggest using this or some other kind of timer
this just aims to make reminding yourself more convenient

every 20 minutes
look at something 20 feet away
for 20 seconds

I'm gonna include the .py file if anyone wants to get this working on linux/mac. 
I eventually plan to do it myself but if by some miracle someone actually does anything with this please let me know!!

The main issue is with playsound and where the sound files are located.
when converted to .exe, playsound won't play nice and doesn't play the sound files.
I'm unsure if this has anything to do with where they're located or how the code is written, but I doubt it.
dad somehow got this to work by running the code on a different IDE on a different computer
playsound version had to be older than the most recent one to work
I'm not asking stackoverflow why it's not working for very obvious reasons
