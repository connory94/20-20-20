HOW TO GET STARTED
======================
- tldr: just download the zip, then extract the zip within the zip (idk why I did this), then put the extracted folder wherever you want. I highly recommend making a shortcut to the .exe file since it's one of those things where it needs to be in its folder to work.

move the shortcut to an easily accessible place, such as the desktop

HOW TO USE
======================
- press the button in the middle to start the timer
- after 20 minutes, a sound will play until you press the button again. doing so will start a 20 second timer
- look at something 20 feet away or further until you hear the noise again. when this happens, the 20 minute timer will automatically start again

ABOUT
======================
there's this rule you can follow to reduce/prevent eye strain when looking at screens for long periods of time:
- every 20 minutes
- look at something 20 feet away
- for 20 seconds

this program serves as a timer that serves as a reminder to take breaks every so often

        - suffered with me through the early hours trying to figure out why it didn't work

   - helped with converting to .exe
         - it worked on his computer and I haven't got the slightest clue as to why



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm including the .py file in case wants to get this working on linux/mac. 
I plan to do this eventually myself, but if anyone attempts to do this for me lmk!!

a problem I ran into when converting this to .exe was that the sounds wouldn't play for some reason.
it worked just fine whenever I pressed "run" on VSCodium
I'm guessing the issue has to do with the version of playsound that was installed before converting?
I say this because Dad got this to work by downgrading playsound on his computer.
He also used a different IDE. doubt that has anything to do with it, but who knows?
I'm not asking stackoverflow for help for very obvious reasons
