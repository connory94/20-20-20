apparently there's this rule that helps to prevent eye strain
eye strain sucks balls so I'd suggest using this or some other kind of timer
this just aims to make reminding yourself more convenient

every 20 minutes
look at something 20 feet away
for 20 seconds

I'm gonna include the .py file if anyone wants to get this working on linux/mac. 
had to mess around with a bunch of stuff to get the sound to play and at this point I'm still not sure how it works.
I'm just done. It works, so I'm moving on.
